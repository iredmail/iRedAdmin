= 0.7 =
    * Improvements:
        + Able to specify sql table name which is used to store real-time
          mailbox quota usage. Defaults to 'used_quota'.
        + Fix improper links in admin log page.
        + New: tools/update_password_with_csv.py, used to reset password by
          reading password from CSV file (format: '<email> <password>').

= 0.6.3 =
    * Fixed issues:
        - Incorrect variable name in libs/ldaplib/connUtis,py:
          settings.LDAP_SERVER_TYPE -> settings.LDAP_SERVER_PRODUCT_NAME.

    * Fixed issues:
        - SECURITY: iRedAdmin accepts any password on FreeBSD and OpenBSD
          if password is stored in BCRYPT hash.
        - SQL backends: Cannot identify separately created global admins.
        - OpenBSD ldapd(*) cannot handle MOD_DELETE correctly, it will
          remove all values of this attribute instead of removing just the
          one we specified.

          As a workaround, we define ldap server name in parameter
          'LDAP_SERVER_NAME'. For ldapd, perform one extra LDAP query to get
          all present values of the attribute first, then remove the one we
          want to delete.

        + Able to generate bcrypt password hash with Python module 'bcrypt' or
          'py-bcrypt'.
          NOTE: It works on BSD systems, but not Linux. Since libc shpped in
                most Linux distributions doesn't bcrypt, Dovecot cannot verify

          Note: SSHA512 requires Dovecot-2.0 (and later), Python-2.5 (or
          later).
